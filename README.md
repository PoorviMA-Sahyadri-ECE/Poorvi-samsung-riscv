Task 1: Install the RISC-V toolchain using the VDI link and Perform GCC Compilation In Both Normal gcc-compiler and RISC-V Based gcc compiler and check the result.
Task 2:: To write a simple C program and to compile the C program using RISC-V GCC/SPIKE with the O1 and Ofast optimization flags and to generate and collect the RISC-V object dump for both -O1 and -Ofast
Task 3:To identify 15 unique RISC-V instructions from the riscv-objdump of my application code and to determine the exact 32 bit instruction code from those 15 instructions
Task 4: By making use of RISCV Core: Verilog Netlist and Testbench, perform an experiment of Functional Simulation and observe the waveforms
Task 5:Develop an IR Sensor-Based Car Proximity Alert System to detect nearby objects and trigger alerts accordingly.
Task 6:Execute and Test the Code for the IR Sensor-Based Car Proximity Alert System, ensuring its proper functionality.
